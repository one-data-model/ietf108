# 2020-10-12 planned ASDF "hallway meeting"

We hope to have the ASDF WG established by early October 2020.
We'll need to wait for another two weeks until we can have an official
interim meeting, where we can make official decisions such as adopting
a draft (to be confirmed on the mailing list, as always).

So we plan to have a "hallway" (inofficial) meeting to do some
planning and preparing.

Time: 2020-10-12, 1300-1430Z
