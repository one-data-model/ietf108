# 2020-10-12 planned ASDF "hallway meeting"

We hope to have the ASDF WG established by early October 2020. At that point,
we'll need to wait for another two weeks until we can have an official
interim meeting, where we can make official decisions such as adopting
a draft (to be confirmed on the mailing list, as always).

So, to get a running start, we plan to have a "hallway" (inofficial) meeting 
to do some planning and preparing on October 12th.

Time: 2020-10-12, 1300-1430Z

(Slightly outdated) 26-minute video tutorial that is recommended for preparation
if you haven't looked at SDF yet:

Agenda is not yet nailed down, but might include:

* Introductions

* Background and minitutorial, Q&A about background

* Structuring work on SDF 1.1

    * Limitations of SDF 1.0

    * Approaches for addressing them

    * Prioritizing for SDF 1.1


For this meeting, we will use the T2TRG webex, see below 

Cheers,

Michael and Niklas
